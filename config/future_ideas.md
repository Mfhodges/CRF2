# Future Ideas for the CRF

### Customize the request form to add in LTIs

### Form to request non-srs Sites
the info we need:


1. How do you intend to use the site? (Sharing documents, assessment, research, etc.)

2. Will any HIPAA-protected information be included in the site? Please note that because of the technical limitations
inherent with the platform, storing HIPAA-protected information is not permitted in Canvas.

3. What is the approximate number of participants in the site?

4. Will all the site participants have PennKeys? PennKeys are required for access to Canvas.

5. Will you be able to provide the following information for all participants: full names, Penn ID Numbers, PennKey
usernames and email addresses
(does not have to be a Penn address, just a current valid email address). We require all this information to create user
accounts and cannot look up information on behalf of non-course site users due to limited staff time.

6. What is the approximate lifetime of the site?

7. When does the site need to be available for users?

8. Will those managing the site require training or have they already used Canvas before?
